Hi, I’m Alex. I am currently building Dialecta and Give Protocol. 

I also work part-time as a community strategist helping crypto builders create their minimum viable communities. I've spent the last 7+ years building communities and community-first businesses as an entrepreneur and community professional in a variety of contexts including education, health, technology and crypto. I started working full time in the crypto industry in 2021 in community roles at The Graph, Hashflow, and most recently as a community lead at SuperLayer, a venture studio in the RLY Ecosystem. Since 2016, I've participated in numerous communities within the crypto space including being a Devcon VI Scholar, Kernel Block 3 Fellow, WGMI Core Contributor, and Blockchain at Berkeley Alumni.

At my most recent startup, IBDCoach, I co-founded a health & wellness platform and support community for Inflammatory Bowel Disease and chronic disease management from concept to production and in its second year drove 800% in net sales volume, achieving a revenue of $150,000 in 2020. In this role I established the company’s first product marketing channels which accounted for 83% of total sales revenue. We grew and trained an expert community of patients to create their own personalized remission protocols to get into remission and live healthy lives.

I'm a community builder and entrepreneur, and I've always been excited about sharing resources about the latest frontier technologies and educating others. My expertise is in building community-based products, marketing, and education. One of the projects I'm really proud of building was when I cofounded United Technologies For Kids while I was at UC Berkeley and built a platform for STEM education from concept to production, implementing 25+ STEM labs and programs in high schools in Peru and Colombia. I also designed a rigorous curriculum to teach 10000+ students how to build social innovation projects that address community problems using technology skills such as 3D printing and design, electronics, programming, and drones.
