## Why have I struggled with being able to write publicly? Let’s ask GPT-4.

For a few months, I’ve been struggling to post publicly anywhere on my public profile, on Twitter and elsewhere.

I asked ChatGPT if it could help me diagnose why I have been struggling by building a prompt:

> Help me understand and work through my resistance to writing publicly by asking questions about my thoughts, emotions, and experiences related to writing for myself, my work, my previous public blog, focusing on writing authentically from my higher self and heart, and using tools like ChatGPT to enhance my writing process. Discuss my interests in AI and language learning, my fears of not being good enough, imposter syndrome, and the importance of self-love in overcoming these challenges. Explore strategies for building self-love and self-acceptance to improve my writing experience, and how embracing my role as an educator, investigator, and explorer will help me connect with my tribe. Reflect on past experiences where you've been able to effectively share your knowledge and connect with like-minded individuals. Discuss ways to improve your public writing so that it better reflects your progress and wisdom in your areas of interest. Consider how sharing your journey can inspire and help others facing similar challenges or fears.

ChatGPT responded with great questions to reflect on:

> It's completely understandable to feel hesitant when writing about subjects that require technical knowledge or are still in the process of discovery for you. To help you overcome these barriers, consider the following questions and suggestions:
>
> 1. In the process of learning about AI, could you document your journey as a newcomer to the field? Sharing your learning experiences, challenges, and breakthroughs could resonate with others who are in a similar situation.
> 2. To build your technical knowledge in AI, are there any online courses, workshops, or mentorship opportunities you could participate in? Continuously expanding your understanding of the subject will help you gain confidence in writing about it.
> 3. For language learning, consider writing about your trials and errors in finding the right approach that works best for you. This could be valuable for readers who are also searching for effective language learning methods.
> 4. Collaborate with other experts in AI or language learning. This could involve conducting interviews, co-writing articles, or seeking feedback on your writing from individuals with more experience in these fields. This approach can help you strengthen your knowledge and credibility.
> 5. Remember that writing doesn't have to be perfect, especially when you're exploring new territories. Give yourself permission to be a learner and focus on continuous improvement in both your understanding of the subjects and your writing.
>
> By addressing these challenges and taking a proactive approach to learning, you'll be better equipped to write publicly about AI and language learning, even as you continue to develop your expertise.

As a starting point, ChatGPT provides really valuable reflective feedback. This is the type of advice I would give to other people. However, it's hard to give myself the same advice because I overthink and overcomplicate tasks for myself.

## Are we more honest with ChatGPT than with ourselves?

I think that the collaborative effort of building a prompt gives us permission to be more honest with ourselves. Sometimes the voice within our own heads may edit or criticize what we write in ways we would not do to others. Talking with ChatGPT is an opportunity to externalize what we are writing and also provide positive constructive reinforcement of discovering which ideas can be developed further without getting stuck in our own minds.

## My current journey and why I am starting to write publicly again.

Here is what I’ve discovered through my process of talking with ChatGPT.

I’ve been going through a transition in life into a new journey. It’s a life journey that is more aligned with my heart, my passions, and my purpose in the world. I’m starting a company to help people learn any language based on their unique interests and goals in life, inspired by my time living in Mexico City.

One of the biggest transformations I’ve gone through in the past year has been living in a foreign country, Mexico, full-time and reimagining my life.

I wasn’t quite happy because I believe that what was missing from my life was the spark for how my direct efforts were helping people.

For the past two years, I worked full-time at a few companies in the crypto industry as a community professional. I consulted on community strategy. I’ve built web3 projects. This experiment led me to explore the digital nomad lifestyle, and led me to Mexico City where I ultimately decided to settle down full-time and choose to live outside the United States for the first time ever in my life.

I realized that my role as a community professional didn’t have enough impact on the people within the communities I was a part of within the crypto industry. 

For most of my past entrepreneurial journey, I believed in this idea about myself: I help people go through transformations in their lives. 

As an entrepreneur, I helped students Peru and Colombia discover their passion for STEM. I helped people with chronic health conditions (Inflammatory Bowel Disease) heal through IBDCoach. And now I’m tackling a problem that is relevant to my life living abroad in Mexico City and relevant to many people considering to move or travel to a new place in the world.

I want to create products that help people transform their lives.

What I’ve noticed about my journey with language learning and travel:

Primary Problem: People want to learn Spanish and the traditional methods of language learning fail because the methods ignore human motivations, interests and goals and try to create a singular way of learning instead of creating a unique learning path for each individual.

Deeper Problem: People want to be less lonely and they want to share their journey in life with other people.

I’m hoping to tackle both of these core problems because they resonate deeply with my current path in life.
